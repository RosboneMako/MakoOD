DISCLAIMER
------------------------------------------------------------------  
This VST was written in a very simple way. Just simple code for
people who are not programmers but want to dabble in the magic of JUCE VSTs.

If you are new to JUCE code, the Mako Thump VST may be a better
starting place. Or be brave and try this. This VST is not too hard to get.

# THEORY OF OPERATION<br />
OVERDRIVE

It is used in front of an amplifer or amp simulator when a little more drive is needed.
